I made this game in Unity. 

It is essentially the original PacMan game, but you are playing it in 3D from PacMan's Point of View. To make
it somewhat different, I also added an underground dimension where everything is inversed, which you can access 
by going into the Ghost House, along with some other mechanics to make the player experience better.

You can download executable files from the Executables folder. Currently, it's only supported in MacOS and Windows.

I hope you enjoy!
