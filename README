I made this game with Unity. 

It is essentially the original PacMan game, but you are playing it in 3D from PacMan's Point of View. To make
it somewhat different, I also added an underground dimension where everyhing is backwards, which you can access 
by going into the Ghost House, along with some other mechanics to make player experience better.

You can download executable files from the Executables folder. Right now it's only supported in MacOS and Windows.
I hope you enjoy!
